Project Title - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation


final-project-starter.yml
Students have to write the CloudFormation code using this YAML template for building the cloud infrastructure, as required for the project.

server-parameters.json
Students may use a JSON file for increasing the generic nature of the YAML code. For example, the JSON file contains a "ParameterKey" as "EnvironmentName" and "ParameterValue" as "UdacityProject".

In YAML code, the ${EnvironmentName} would be substituted with UdacityProject accordingly.
